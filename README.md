The aim of this project is to organize the information in the 31 seasons of Bob Ross's Joy of Painting series
and support a web-development project on the subject.

Goals:
-Produce materials lists for paint and brushes
-Create amazon carts for the necessary materials for any given episode
-Explore several machine learning options for the corpus (~1.5 million words), such as a Bob Ross speech constructor
-Publish other data for each episode, such as a sentiment score and wordclouds
-Use unsupervised learning methods to perform episode clustering, generate cosine similarities, and eventually support
    a recommendation system for the final site.
